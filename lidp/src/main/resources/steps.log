Lots of new things to download and use for first time

GIT
    Downloaded from https://git-scm.com/download/win
    Updated the EGit Eclipse plugin to 4.6.0
    
Gradle
    Downloaded v4.10.2 binary from https://gradle.org/install/
        Did not put on path (will do iff nec.)
    Installed Eclipse plugin "Buildship Gradle Integration 2.0"
    
Spring Boot
    Used Spring Initializr (https://start.spring.io/) to create project
        Imported to Eclipse as Gradle project
    Changed port to 80 in application.properties ("a.p")
        Seems to work
        Used stackoverflow to see how to get app to set landing page

Github
    Wrote some code; would be good to save it.
    Created account.
    
GIT
    Started to commit (locally, it seems).
    Picked a directory as a repository.
    Tried "Commit...", wrote comment, clicked Commit button,
    told "there are no staged files".  What?
        Had to move files from "Unstaged Changes" to "Staged Changes".

Github
    How to get code in there?  Can do from Eclipse?
    Followed instructions here:
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17552457/how-do-i-upload-eclipse-projects-to-github/17559921
    Not sure what "origin" meant for the "remote name".
    I see stuff on github; i guess it's ok?
    
Angular
    Experience from above: maybe i can get an Eclipse plugin w/out installing externally
    Found Angular IDE.  Tried dragging install icon to Eclipse.  Msg: "not compatible" (i have Mars).
    OK, install Angular at OS level.
    Need Angular CLI?  Probably...
    First need npm and node.js!
        Went to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and did 64-bit .msi download
        node -v: v8.12.0
        npm -v: 6.4.1
    Ran: npm install -g @angular/cli
        Couple warnings but seemed to work
    Do i need to make a whole new project or can i "angular-ify" my existing lidp project?
        Will make the test app shown on https://angular.io/guide/quickstart in temp dir
        my-app has > 3,600 dirs and ~28,000 files!  No way the project needs all this.
        Ran: ng serve --open
            This did indeed bring up the app in FF
