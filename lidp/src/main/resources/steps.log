Lots of new things to download and use for first time

GIT
    Downloaded from https://git-scm.com/download/win
    Updated the EGit Eclipse plugin to 4.6.0
    
Gradle
    Downloaded v4.10.2 binary from https://gradle.org/install/
        Did not put on path (will do iff nec.)
    Installed Eclipse plugin "Buildship Gradle Integration 2.0"
    
Spring Boot
    Used Spring Initializr (https://start.spring.io/) to create project
        Imported to Eclipse as Gradle project
    Changed port to 80 in application.properties ("a.p")
        Seems to work
        Used stackoverflow to see how to get app to set landing page

Github
    Wrote some code; would be good to save it.
    Created account.
    
GIT
    Started to commit (locally, it seems).
    Picked a directory as a repository.
    Tried "Commit...", wrote comment, clicked Commit button,
    told "there are no staged files".  What?
